I am a PhD student of Animal Science & Computational Mathematics, Science and Engineering (dual major) at Michigan State University. My research interests include precision livestock farming, computer vision, genomic prediction, and deep learning. I work on automatic detection of housed pigs' agonistic behaviors through computer vision tools. Also, I develop deep learning models for genomic prediction in animals. I have fun with applying different algorithms to solve practical problems in the field of Animal Science e.g. genomic prediction/selection and animal behavior analysis.
